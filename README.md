# ðŸ§© Fillomino Puzzle Game

Fillomino is a logic puzzle where the goal is to divide a grid into **polyominoes** â€” connected groups of cells â€” such that:
- Each group contains exactly as many cells as the number it displays.
- No two polyominoes of the same size touch side-by-side.

This app provides an interactive way to play Fillomino puzzles, with boards generated using a SAT solver to ensure each puzzle has a **unique solution**.

## ðŸ“– About the Application

This Fillomino puzzle game generates boards by encoding the puzzle rules into logical formulas solved by a SAT solver. The solver finds valid solutions that satisfy all puzzle constraints, ensuring each generated board has a unique and correct solution.

To handle complex shapesâ€”especially large polyominoesâ€”some patterns were precomputed and saved in a file (`polyominos.txt`). During board generation, these precomputed shapes are loaded from the file and reused, which avoids costly recomputation and speeds up the process.

   - Use the mouse or keyboard to select values to fill the board. The available numbers correspond to the maximum polyomino size chosen.  
   - Correct polyominoes are highlighted in different colors.  
   - Incorrect polyominoes are highlighted in red.
